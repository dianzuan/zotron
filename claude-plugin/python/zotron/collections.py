"""Collection-tree helpers.

`resolve_collection` (in push.py) handles the write-path — it uses the
flat `collections.list` and raises on ambiguity. For read paths that
traverse the nested hierarchy (OCR batch, RAG index), use
`find_by_name` below: it calls `collections.tree` and returns the first
match by name, or None.
